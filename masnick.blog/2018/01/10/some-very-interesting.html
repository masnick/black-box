      <p>Some very interesting thoughts by <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs">Tiago Forte</a> in a  <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/864331551873482752">Twitter thread</a>, which I&rsquo;ve reposted here for readability:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m increasingly convinced that THE most important thing in productivity is to end every cycle with a clear milestone or deliverable</p>

<p>Both &ldquo;deep work&rdquo; (large batch) and &ldquo;multitasking&rdquo; (small batch) miss the point in this regard</p>

<p>The absolute size of your work batches doesn&rsquo;t matter, and a wide range of sizes is probably best</p>

<p>But if u don&rsquo;t end your cycle with a clear deliverable, you&rsquo;re de-optimizing the next cycle before it&rsquo;s even begun</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll either have to spend the entire next cycle tying up loose ends of previous one, OR remembering what you started in previous one</p>

<p>Latter is not as innocuous as it seems. Its difficult to pick back up smthg that was begun, but not brought far enough 2 reduce ambiguity</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re left with the constraints of previous work session, but w/out benefits of clearly defined next steps</p>

<p>But it goes deeper. By finishing w/ an artifact, physical or conceptual or visual, you have something to ponder between sessions</p>

<p>The mind cannot creatively ponder messy work-in-process. Occurs as a morass of open loops, no anchor to push back on</p>

<p>A deliverable is a thingified idea - it provides distinctions, decisions, constraints, affordances that can be embraced, or rejected</p>

<p>Thingified ideas provide another benefit in rapidly changing, networked world: u can get feedback on them, improving orientation</p>

<p>Key skill in matching cycle time to delivery pace is acceleration (and deceleration)</p>

<p>Simple level: be able to cram in that last bit of work to finish it in this work session, instead of pushing it to next one or deceleration: know when to slow down and &gt; really do the most thorough job, instead of maintaining speed and starting smthg new&gt;</p>

<p>Complex level: know how to align life rhythms so that cycle time and deliverables fluctuate in sync, to the same rhythm</p>

<p>This involves multiple skills: next-level calendaring/scheduling, rapidly creating conditions for flow, setting/enforcing blackout times abruptly changing states of mind, &gt; self-awareness to know limits, defining tasks/deliverables and their interfaces, distraction mgmt&gt;</p>

<p>It also means spending more time planning (all aspects of life), relative to doing, which feels to many like lowered productivity</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s necessary, because planning has way more leverage available to it than doing. Doing is base, planning is exponent</p>

<p>Also shows why very healthy body and mind is critical. It limits sprint/stamina at most fundamental, hardware level</p>

<p>Thus a tiny constraint at hardware level magnifies into massive constraint at mind (software) level. Ceiling on cycle time limits range</p>

<p>Also shows why maintaining relationships/hobbies is important. These cannot be pulled on demand, operate on much longer cycles</p>

<p>And the reserves they fill (love, connection, acceptance, humor) cannot effectively be filled any other way</p>

<p>Ability to quickly and thoroughly relax is probably key capability required. Middle ground of low level stress shortens next cycle</p>

<p>W/out producing clear deliverable, or even planning of next deliverable, which is hard to do when stressed</p>

<p>But walking away when a deliverable is finished is very hard, bec all biomarkers are attuned to immediate gratification &amp; stimulation</p>

<p>Dopamine provides anticipation + pleasure, whereas serotonin lacks anticipation, making it hard to pursue in presence of former</p>

<p>After yrs of time-tracking I almost never work more than 30 hrs/wk, bec there&rsquo;s no point in working if I can&rsquo;t produce a deliverable</p>

<p>Better to spend that time creating the conditions for massive acceleration, which brings exponential rewards</p>
